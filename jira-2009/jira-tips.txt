Submitting Good Bugs (see wiki)
* Developers should avoid writing quick-and-dirty issues. What happens when priorities change, and the problem isn't looked at for the next six month
* Before entering a bug - search for duplicates!! 2000+ bugs Maybe this bug has been entered (and possibly resolved?)
* Write good summaries/descriptions - you should err in favour of putting too much information in a summary, rather than too little.
* JIRA handles screenshots and attachments!
