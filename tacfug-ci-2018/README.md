# Continuous Integration 

Presented at TACFUG March 2018 by Jim Priest

This presentation discusses moving away from manually configuring 
your continuous integration environment and instead embracing the 
concept of "Configuration as Code" and creating scripts to stand up
and configure your environments.

An example Dockerfile and Jenkinsfile are provided.
